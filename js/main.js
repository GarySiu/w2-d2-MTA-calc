// OLD IDEA. Do not use. Also you can't name your variables starting with a number stupid!
// //Store the stations in an array for each line
// var n_line = ["Times Square", "34th", "28th", "23rd", "Union Square", "8th"];
// var l_line = ["8th","6th","Union Square","3rd","1st"]
// var 6_line = ["Grand Central","33rd","28th","23rd","Union Square","Astor Place"]
